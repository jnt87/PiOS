_start: 
The [1:0] bits of the MPIDR_EL1 register are read Aff0, yielding the core number thats currently executing code. If the number is zero, go to setup, otherwise call WFE in an infinite loop

halt: 
calls wfe in a infinite loop - wait for event lets it go to a low-power mode and wait until a wakeup occurs

setup: 
stores the address at _start into the stack pointer

reads the current exception level in 0
masks bits [3:2] - all other bits reserved
shifts the bits right logically 2

switch_to_el2:
if the bits indicate EL3
switch to EL2
if not jump down to switch to EL1

(switch to el2)
setup the secure configuration register
bits 0, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10
10: RW - if el2 is present, its aarch64 and controls el1 and el0 behaviors
8: HCE bit = hypervisor calls at EL1 and above
7: SMD secure monitor call disabled at EL1 and above
5: RES1 
4: RES1
0: NS - non-secure bit memory accesses from el1 and el0 cannot access Secure memory

stores the bits into the SCR_EL3 register

sets up SPSR_EL3
bits 0, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9
9: D bit watchpoint, breakpoint, and software step exceptions targeted at the currention exception level are masked
8: A bit determines if SErrors are masked
7: I bit irq are masked
6: F bit FIQ are masked
[3:0] : because its 0x9 it shows it sets the state of the exception at EL2h 

sets x2 to the address of switch_to_el1
stores the address in ELR_EL3 - exception link

eret lowers the level

switch_to_el1:
compares x0 - the exception level to see if its in EL1 if not skip to set_stack

sets the stack pointer to _start

reads CNTHCTL_EL2 into x0 - counter-timer hypervisor control
sets the [1:0] bits high - EL1PCTEN and ELPCEN - not instructions can be trapped
stores 0 to CNTVOFF_EL2 - counter timer virtual offset register

sets RW and VM for the hypervisor configuration register (EL2)
RW: EL1 is aarch64, el0 will take the pstate.nRW
VM: non secure EL1&0 state 2 address translation enabled

sets the CPTR_EL2 to zero - meaning dont trap instructions accessing SVE registers

reads the  access control register CPACR_EL1
turns on bits [21:20]
enabling FPEN bits - this control does not cause instructions to be trapped

set SCTLR to known state
7: ITD - IT disable
4: SAO - SP alignment check enable for EL0 - alignment to 16 BYTE bounds

set bits 0, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9 in SPSR_EL2
9: D bit watchpoint breakpoint and software step exceptions targeted at the current exception level are masked
8: SError masked
7: IRQ masked
6: FIQ masked
[3:0]: sets up the exception as being called form EL1h

set_stack:
sets the stack pointer to _start

go_kmain: 
BL - branch and store return address - hint to predictor this is a function call
if it returns Branch to halt - loops with WFE in low-power

Context_restore:
ret - returns to x30, hints to branch prediction logic that its a function return
