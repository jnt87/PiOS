I could free up the memory that i jump over in the search for perfect alignment so that they are in bins instead of ignored forever :(

you could implement a slab allocator and give all the space to one block, splitting as you need to and merging on the way back up

old space - new space - this would reuire you to stop the world in downtime, and compact the data
