 I went from 2^3 to 2^30
Upon request for data, my allocator tries to fulfill it with a bin then allocates more memory if needed
the fragmentation is very very bad - its not important what the actual numbers are - mine will never make it to production
the fragmentation is generated by aligning new blocks of memory above the heap ptr to a certain address. this generates small block of memory
